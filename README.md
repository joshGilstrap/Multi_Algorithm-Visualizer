## Algorithms

- **Sorting Algorithms**: Bubble Sort, COMING SOON: Selection Sort, Heap Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort.
- **Pathfinding Algorithms**: BFS, DFS, and A* algorithms on a fully-interactable grid with auto=maze generation.
- **Graph Algorithms**: BFS and DFS algorithms on a node-based graph system. Several built-in common graphs with customizaiton abilities.
